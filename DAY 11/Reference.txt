Examples of valid IPv4 address

192.168.0.1 – This address is valid because it consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots, each number is between 0 and 255, and the first number is not 0 (which is reserved for special purposes).
10.0.0.1 – This address is valid because it consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots, each number is between 0 and 255, and the first number is 10 (which is a reserved private IP address range).
172.16.0.1 – This address is valid because it consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots, each number is between 0 and 255, and the first two numbers are 172 and 16 (which is another reserved private IP address range).
127.0.0.1 – This address is valid because it consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots, each number is between 0 and 255, and it is a special address that represents the loopback interface (used for testing and troubleshooting network connectivity).


Examples of Invalid IPv4 Addresses

256.168.0.1 – This address is invalid because the first number is 256, which is outside the range of 0 to 255.
192.168.0.300 – This address is invalid because the last number is 300, which is outside the range of 0 to 255.
192.168.1 – This address is invalid because it does not consist of four decimal numbers separated by dots.
192.168.01.1 – This address is invalid because the third number has a leading zero, which is not allowed in IPv4 addresses.
192.168.0.0/24 – This address is invalid because it contains a subnet mask (represented by the /24) which is not part of the IP address itself.
0.0.0.0 – This address is invalid because it is reserved for special purposes and cannot be used as a valid IP address.


How can I identify a valid IP address?

To check if an IPv4 address is valid, you can perform the following steps:

Check that the address consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots.
Check that each decimal number is between 0 and 255.
Check that the first decimal number is not 0, as it is reserved for special purposes.
Check that the last decimal number is not 255, as it is reserved for broadcast addresses.
Check that the address does not conflict with any other address on the same network.
Alternatively, you can use an online tool or a command-line tool to check if an IPv4 address is valid and reachable.
